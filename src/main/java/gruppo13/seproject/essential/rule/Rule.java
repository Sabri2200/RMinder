/*
The `Rule` class is a core component of a Java application, representing a rule that consists of actions to be executed based on a trigger.

1. Attributes:
   - `name`: A `String` representing the name of the rule.
   - `actions`: A `List<Action>` representing the actions to be executed when the rule is triggered.
   - `trigger`: A `Trigger` object that defines the condition under which the actions should be executed.
   - `ruleState`: An enumeration (`RuleState`) that represents the current state of the rule (e.g., active, inactive).
   - `nextActivation`: An `int` that could represent the time or condition for the next activation of the rule.

2. Constructors:
   - The class provides two constructors:
     - The first constructor initializes the rule with a name, list of actions, trigger, and rule state, setting `nextActivation` to 0 by default.
     - The second constructor additionally allows specifying the `nextActivation` parameter. This parameter will be helpful if the actions must be executed again after `nextActivation` minutes.

3. Getters:
   - The class provides getter methods for all its attributes (`getName`, `getActions`, `getTrigger`, `getState`, `getNextActivation`), allowing other parts of the application to access these properties.

4. Set State:
   - The `setState(RuleState ruleState)` method allows changing the state of the rule, which can be used to activate or deactivate the rule based on certain conditions.
